## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plastic-detection.git
    cd plastic-detection
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**

    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Running the Project

1. Ensure you have the necessary model files in the correct directories:
    - YOLO model weights: `yolo_weights/yolov9s_54epochs_best.pt`
    - CNN model: `CNN models/modern_CNN.keras`

2. Start the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3. Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
